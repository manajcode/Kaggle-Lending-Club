# Lending Club Analysis
This folder contains the necessary code to implement my classification analysis on the refined, lending club data.

This folder contains the following items:

1. cleaneddata.rds: The sub-sampled lending club data produced from the LC_Data_Prep sub-project

2. LC Analysis.Rmd: the Rmarkdown file containing the code for this project.

3. LC Analysis.Rproj: The Rproject file; please run this file first if you want to edit any code, files, or the repository itself.

4. LC_Project_Report.Rmd: An R markdown file that summarise the results and interpretations of my analysis. I knitted this report and submitted this file for my Statistical Learning course in my Master's program at CSU East Bay.
