# Kaggle Lending Club 
This project is based on the original Kaggle competition which occured in 2017 (https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data). Here, I attempt to classify Lenders into risky or safe borrowers and in so doing, predict whether they will default or pay their bills.

This project is broken into two sub projects: A data preperation component and an analysis component, represented by the two folders in this repository.

The data preperation folder contains the work I completed to download, extract, and munge the data. At the time of the analysis, I did not have enough RAM to analyze the eintre data set. Thus, I took a 20% sample of the data. The steps to performing the sample are in this folder.

The data analysis folder contains the code to work with the sample data for further data munging and machine learning classification techniques.
